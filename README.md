Markmeld is a markdown melder. It merges yaml and markdown content using jinja2 templates. You configure markmeld with your content in computer-readable .md and .yaml files, and markmeld helps produce polished, publication-ready versions of your content, such as a PDF or HTML format. Markmeld is useful for many types of output document, including resumes, biosketches, manuscripts, proposals, books, and more.
